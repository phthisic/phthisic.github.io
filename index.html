                This photo is taken in Alishan, Taiwan in August 2014. It was a foggy morning and the train had been
                stopped a month ago. <br>
                When the train did not work, the rail seemed more beautiful with the fog.<br>
                It always inspires me.

                        <h3>The War of Theirs</h3>
                        <p>This project is a website combined history and music to give the target audiences an
                            experience of WW1. By using the data from Queensland database, we are able to reproduce
                            the
                            music and link it to the historical photos. As the main focus is the experience of the
                            life
                            and art during the WW1period, the name of the website is “The war of theirs.” <br> <br>
                            I am the programmer in the team and take all the responsibility of the code. However, I
                            also
                            acted as a designer and actively giving my idea about the website. The website is mainly
                            based on PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML together with CSS forms the appearance and
                            data
                            is read and presented by PHP and JavaScript. <br> <br>

                    <p>The designed installation was named “Symphony,” which was an art installation
                        prompting people to trigger different parts of the music and then remix together.
                        When one user interacts with the installation, one type of music would be activated,
                        as more and more people getting involved in the installation, the played music would
                        be more pleasant.</p>

                    <p>The installation of “Symphony” is planned to install by the UQ Lake in a place where
                        people have relaxing willing. And the purpose of this installation is to add some
                        music elements into a place, making people feel comfortable and enjoying the
                        environment with smooth melodies and the embrace of nature. The purpose of the
                        project is to create a collective experience and enchanting affection for the people
                        feel the pressure. Additionally, the way of engaging more people to interact with that
                        is to encourage people who don’t know each other to participate with our system
                        and evoke the passion of making new friends. The technology in this project includes
                        the pressure-sensitive sensor to detect the users’ weight and then trigger the play
                        of music. And the central computer will certify how many people interact with the
                        installation so play music with different complexity.</p>
                    <p>We are ambitious that our installation would be like by the people around the
                        campus and the visitors. We have walked through the path of the procedure of
                        collecting ideas and insights, analysing the needs from the users, videoing and
                        holding two exhibitions around the campus.</p>

                    <p>Based on the science fiction “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” this
                        website is designed to educate the fundamental knowledge of universe and
                        space physics, targeting children aged from seven to fifteen. This design report
                        includes the background of this website and the process of design.<br> <br>
                        The target audience is children aged between 7 and 15, who have developed
                        the ability of abstract thinking and proper to learn simple physics knowledge.
                        Thus, it is suitable for them to start learning the universe and space physics.
                        The selected science fiction, published in 1979, is unlikely to be read by the
                        target audience before and the story happened in the space. Hence, this book
                        can serve not only as an enlightening of science fiction for children but also as
                        exciting teaching material for universe and space physics.

                        cards were sorted separately. After the analysis of the process of this activity,
                        the organization system has been modified based on the feedback given by the

                        The group discussion went through two websites including Alibaba and Amazon.
                        Having compared their navigation system, the clearance and necessity of each
                        navigation system and the importance of breadcrumb are highlighted. Moreover,
                        by creating the site map, the navigation and content can be overviewed. Using
                        Lara, one of the personas created, and storyboard to illustrate how the user

                        The other group discussion focused on the website of Amazon. The consistent
                        elements and emphasis of the visual organization have been highlighted.
                        Considering the discussion, the visual organization of this website has been
                        modified, and the wireframes have been produced (the wireframes include
                        those of the first visit page, explore page, guidebook page, search page and
                        customize color page).

                        The paper prototype test, which based on the wireframes, involved three
                        participants. After the analysis of the process and feedback, some function of
                        buttons and prompt have been modified. Besides, during the test, the tutor
                        pointed out that technically, there will not be a database to store the username
                        and password. Therefore, all the functions linked to the users' account need to
                        be redesigned.

                        The aesthetics test is conducting to determaine whether the color, font,
                        image used and button used is suitable for the content and user experience.
                        The prototype changed in this step as the feedback from participants showed
                        that the initial prototype was not suitable.<br> <br>
                        With the new prototype, the aesthetics test was reconducted and based on
                        the feedback, a hi-fi prototype was conducted. The final change isbased on
                        the feedback of hi-fi prototype.</p>

                    <p>
                        This prototype is a game of simulating the hatching and players would be hungry in the game. The
                        idea is generated by the website “Game Generator” (figure 1.1) but the animals has changed to
                        monsters and getting bored has changed to losing the physical and mental strength.
                    </p>

                    <p>The game mainly contains four parts, weighing, hatching, store and player status. The weighing
                        system is where players weigh the eggs and decided where to hatch the eggs. The hatching system
                        is where the players place the eggs and waiting for the monster to be born. The store is where
                        the player sells the monster and buy more eggs or foods. Player would lose physical strength
                        when hatching the eggs so they need to eat to stay alive. They can choose to eat cheap monster
                        meat to increase some physical strength but would lose mental strength. Or, they can choose to
                        eat expensive normal food to get both physical and mental strength. The game ends when either
                        the physical or the mental strength become zero.<br> <br>
                        To interact with the game, a pressure sensor decorated as a weighing scale and a physical
                        platform with controllers would be used. Players use the weighing scale to weigh the eggs and
                        the weight would display on the screen. Players can move the controller on the platform, which
                        in the game is the action of moving in the game scene or moving the little ghost assistant. The
                        platform is also the simulation of the store where users can choose to buy products.

                    <p>The prototype is a unity scene which contains the system of buying, weighing, hatching and
                        collection displaying. The buying has been simplified to spend money and gain energy. Images
                        from the Internet are used to build up the scene and some coding are used to provide the basic
                        interaction.<br> <br>
                        The prototype also linked to the physical controller by using Arduino. Two potentiometers are
                        used to move to different part of the scene and move the ghost. A photocell is used to feed the
                        players. A gravity sensor FlexiForce is used to weighing the egg. All the physical controller
                        has been put into a box which stands for the laboratory. And some text has been written on the
                        box to indicate the players.

                        The first one is buying eggs. Players are able to buy an egg from the provider and the egg is
                        randomly provided. Once they buy the egg, the egg would be placed on the shelf from top to
                        bottom.

                        egg. Players are able to control the ghost, moving it up and down. By short press the main
                        control button, the ghost would take the egg from the shelf or put it back. The egg’s position
                        is decided by the ghost position. If players long press the main control button, the ghost would
                        put the egg on the weighing scale.</p>

                        part-selecting a place to hatch. The incubator has point out which part should be putted at
                        which position. The ghost would, again, help players to put the egg at right position.</p>

                        the monster. When long press the main control button and begin to hatching, all the eggs would
                        go into the tube and players are able to begin a new round of weighing. After hatching, the
                        monster would show up at the monster box. If there are not enough eggs on the shelf, the monster
                        can still be hatched but the success possibility would be reduced. If the hatching is failed,
                        players can only get ash at the end. </p>

                        hatching. However, the function hasn’t been fully built as it is not crucial in this prototype
                        to be tested. </p>

                        Players are expected to first put the eggs on the weighing scale and then press the button to
                        weigh the egg. After knowing the weight, they need to check which position is the best place to
                        put the egg and when the four position all have their eggs, players can begin to hatching.

                    <p>
                        The last part is the player status data. The data includes two parts, money and energy. Every
                        time players buy an egg, it would cost money, and hatching monsters can give the money back. If
                        a monster is been successfully hatched, players can get more money than the eggs cost. However,
                        there is a chance that players could not success, so that is when they can only get a little
                        money. </p>

                        The action of weighing and hatching can cost energy. When the energy become 0, the game ends.
                        But the money can be spent to buy energy. This is regarded as the simulation of selling monsters
                        and buying food.
