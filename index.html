                This photo is taken in Alishan, Taiwan in August 2014. It was a foggy morning and the train had been
                stopped a month ago. <br>
                When the train did not work, the rail seemed more beautiful with the fog.<br>
                It always inspires me.

                        <h3>Introduction</h3>
                        <p>This project is a website combined history and music to give the target audiences an
                            experience of WW1. By using the data from Queensland database, we are able to reproduce the
                            music and link it to the historical photos. As the main focus is the experience of the life
                            and art during the WW1period, the name of the website is “The war of theirs.” <br> <br>
                            I am the programmer in the team and take all the responsibility of the code. However, I also
                            acted as a designer and actively giving my idea about the website. The website is mainly
                            based on PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML together with CSS forms the appearance and data
                            is read and presented by PHP and JavaScript. <br> <br>

                        <h3>Design Exploration</h3>
                        <p>When I first explore the qld.data, I want to find something fun and artistic. Music is just
                            what I want. Thus, I decided to use the data of WW1 music. My initial thought is to use the
                            music to teach history, as there are also many databases of the WW1.</p>
                        <img src="image/7180work3.png" title="My initial idea record by journal"
                            alt="My initial idea record by journal">
                        <p>I noticed that there is music sheet in the database which can be used to teach the audience
                            music notes. Thus, my idea became to used the music sheet to present both the historical
                            music and knowledge about music notes.</p>
                        <img src="image/7180work4.png" title="Idea change record by journal"
                            alt="Idea change record by journal">
                        <p>Based on the finding that there are plenty of WW1 photos in the database. I came up with
                            another idea that a big picture formed by little pieces of photos can be used to present the
                            history.</p>
                        <img src="image/7180work5.png" title="New idea record by journal"
                            alt="New idea record by journal">
                        <h4>Reflection on the methods to generate ideas:</h4>
                        <p>The main method has been used for getting design idea is gap-filling. There are many data on
                            the website that can be used, but in the meanwhile, it was difficult to decide what and how
                            to use them. Thus, what I did, was to write down the data that might be used and some
                            different kind or style of websites. I'm required to think of how the data can be used to
                            link to the websites.
                            <br> <br>
                            This method narrowed down the data and helped me think of more detailed ways of using it.
                            The process is easier but the idea can also be limited.

                            Another method is five whys. Actually, this method did not help a lot as I always stopped
                            and could not continue to ask. I think this method can work better in a team rather than
                            only by myself. What's more, I think this method can give some detailed idea of using the
                            data so it might work better when I finally decide what data to use and try to find a way to
                            use it.

                            <h4>Redesign the idea:</h4>
                            <p>
                                Ideas has been quickly changed through the methods. I focused on the two main idea and
                                tried
                                to find a way to having both the music and photos in my website. Then, considering the
                                initial aim is to giving people an experience of WW1, instead of teaching the music
                                notes, I
                                decided to use the music notes to present to historical photos. Each notes is a picture
                                and
                                when users hover on them, the picture would shows.</p>

                            <h4>Reflection on the methods to redesign ideas:</h4>
                            <p>I used brainstorming, brainstorming and mind map during this period. I think the
                                combination of brainstorming and mind map can help us organize the data efficiently if
                                we can select the data firstly. This is also the best research method I used during the
                                whole process and the design method I want to recommend to the team.<br> <br>
                                However, some methods did not work with my design. The black hats of the "six-hats"
                                cannot help me efficiently because its function is finding the drawback during the
                                process. With the help of the "relevance" in the RESEARCH method, I can figure out my
                                drawback clearly.

                        <h3>PartA</h3>
                        <p>What I have done for part A is mainly contributing my opinion about the website. After the
                            pitch at the fourth week, it’s time to become a group.
                            A very useful method here is the world café. As my first choice of the database is music, I
                            spent some time at the music table. What we discuss about the music is focused on the target
                            audiences and domain. At first, we thought about the website can be designed for the old
                            people who want to recall the old days back to WW1. But in the second round, one of the
                            classmates pointed out that WW1 is too far away from nowadays.
                            <br> <br>
                            So, we reconsidered it, starting from the domain. The domain can be divided into two parts,
                            music and history. Thus, the website can be designed for music lovers who want to know about
                            music during the war. Or people who want to learn music sheet as there are many photos of
                            music notes. Or people who want to collect the music covers. Also, the website can be
                            designed for people who want to explore the Queensland’s history during the WW1 period. This
                            part of discussion was used when the group begin to work.

                            The group was formed after the world café activity and luckily, all of our group members
                            were interested in the music element. During the discussion around part A, I contribute to
                            the key interaction of our website, the music sheet. Allowing users interact with the music
                            sheet, they can explore the historical photos which are in the same time when the music was
                            produced.<br> <br>
                            What’s more, as we noticed that there is only music sheet in the database, and we could not
                            find the resources of music, we were facing the possibility that we had to give up this
                            idea. Finally, I found a software called Musescore and successfully reproduce a piece of
                            music. It was not hard since I have learned piano for several years, but it did make sure
                            that our idea could be developed further.<br> <br>
                        </p>
                        <h4>Reflection on part A</h4>
                        <p>
                            Part A was quite unobstructed as our group members, at most of the time, are quite quickly
                            to reach an agreement. Our idea was mainly based on the music sheet, music player and the
                            photos. When we discussed the interact flow, we were not quite sure about whether we should
                            build all the things in one single page, or separate them to several pages. One good thing I
                            think we have done is that we did not just give up the other idea. On contrary, we decided
                            to see which one is better when building the demo.

                        <p>There is not much time for us to build the demo. Thus, we quickly discussed on the
                            interaction flow and then begin to work on the coding.<br> <br>
                            Since we organized the content and realized that the music and photo content should be two
                            separate part, we picked up the other interaction flow that had not been used in the part A.
                            What’s more, we added the music player in every page to always allow the users access to the
                            music.

                        <p>
                            The coding part of the team work actually did not go very well, as I am not satisfied with
                            the other programmer's work. The initial plan was that the other programmer would code a
                            rough demo and I would complete the detail and finish the demo. However, when I got the
                            rough demo, I was extremely disappointed. It was true that the demo was following our
                            discussion, but I really could agree that he treated it seriously.<br> <br>
                            For instance, in the sketch, we had a navigation bar at the top of each picture. Obviously,
                            this is a primary navigation bar fixing at the top of each page, and when users browse each
                            section in the page, the navigation bar would always be there. However, in the rough demo,
                            there were several navigation bars in one page. He gave each section a navigation.<br> <br>
                            The result was that I rebuilt the pages and talked about this among the group. We finally
                            decided to let the other programmer become a designer and I would code all the rest
                            works.<br> <br>
                            When I review the whole issue, I realized that I was not good at the team work part as I
                            could just tell him that the quality of the rough demo is not satisfying. For the next time
                            when I work in a team, I would focus more on the communication with the team members.

                        <p>From this part, as I am the only programmer in our team, I spent all my time on the coding
                            and negotiating with the other three designers. I wanted to implement as much as we want to
                            have. However, the fact is there were many things I need to learn to complete the website.
                            Thus, building the final prototype took me a really long time.<br> <br>
                            My working process has been recorded by the journal. Starting with the home page, then move

                        <p>
                            PHP is a whole new language for me. This is the first back-end language that I have ever
                            used. However, now I have to say, PHP is really great.<br> <br>
                            When I use html and want to change a link in the primary navigation, I have to change all
                            the pages. But with PHP, I can only change one single php, and it would apply to all the
                            pages. What’s more, the process of reading data from JS and pass to the PHP is elegant. I
                            really enjoy using PHP. However, I still found that I was rewriting some sentences in each
                            PHP and I did not know what should I do to put them all in one function. Because of the time
                            limitation, I did not review my coding and made it looks better.

                        <p>I enjoy building my portfolio, this is a chance for me to build a website that I always want
                            to have. I have thought about the vertical navigation for a long time, but I did not have
                            the change to code it as either the website is design to meet the users demand or I was in a
                            team work.<br> <br>
                            To finish this website, I viewed some websites with vertical navigation to find some design
                            inspiration. At last, I focused on Origin’s software.

                        <p>
                            The vertical navigation is always at the left side of the website. Users’ location in the
                            website is always clear so I did not use the breadcrumb. What’s more, I tried to cancel some
                            pages’ title. For example, in the work page, there are only the gallery of the works, but
                            the location is obvious as the vertical navigation has been highlighted.

                        <h3>Reflection on Course</h3>
                        <h4>Reflection on methods</h4>
                        <p>First of all, one thing that has been went through the whole semester is the journal. In this
                            semester, I kept journals for three courses, which actually, gave me lots of stress. I am
                            not a person that used to keep a journal, not in before, and I do not think I am now, liking
                            it. I can understand that the aim of keeping a journal is to document the idea changes and
                            design process, it is also a good way to record all the works that I have done. However, it
                            also took large amount of time for me to write them down. If the journal is just for
                            recording, I think there are many other ways that works better than writing journal. But if
                            it is for help generate new ideas, I really do not think it helps a lot. Maybe I have used
                            the journal in a wrong way. </p>
                        <p>I like to use notes to record my new ideas as it is always accessible. I can stick it on the
                            wall where I always can see. Sometimes, when looking at the notes, I can find the connection
                            between them and it generate new ideas. Notes is not a good a way to document things. Once I
                            use the idea, I just drop that piece of notes. However, it does help me a lot in this
                            course, better than the journal.</p>
                        <p>Another issue is that, I always taken photos of the work had done in the course and planned
                            to organize it after the course. However, the fact is that I almost never reviewed them.
                            Taking photos is a good thing but I really need to use them in a right way. Just press the
                            shutter would not help me memorize anything or generate anything.</p>
                        <h4>Reflection on course content and team work</h4>
                        <p>For the course content, it is interesting to use the database to build a website. The process
                            of thinking which databases can be used, how they can be connected, what is the possible way
                            to display them are all exciting.</p>
                        <p>Through the team work, it is hard to say that the cooperation is perfect. In the last
                            semester, I worked with other two team members in the DECO7110, and we were happy with each
                            other. Thus, in this time’s team work, the new team member was obviously not fit into us. I
                            think we worked well at first, but when the new team member shows us the working process, I
                            was the first one that questioned the quality of the work.<br> <br>
                            For me, I have to admit that although I like to share my idea about the project, I do not
                            like to communicate about others work, even they need suggestions. I always just tell them
                            " stop doing that, I will take the work from now." I think this would make others really
                            upset.

                        <p>I might try the journal again, when I do not have to keep three journals at same time. I
                            believe this can be a useful method, and I just need to figure out the right way to use it.
                            Instead of just thinking about the work I have done, I need more time to thinking about how
                            well I have used the journal.</p>
                        <p>I would also think more about how I should cooperate with other team members. I really need
                            to trust in others, and believe they can also do the work very well. This can help me build
                            a good relationship between others and also, reduce my work load.</p>

                    <h3>Symphony (DECO7110)</h3>
                    <p>The designed installation was named “Symphony,” which was an art installation
                        prompting people to trigger different parts of the music and then remix together.
                        When one user interacts with the installation, one type of music would be activated,
                        as more and more people getting involved in the installation, the played music would
                        be more pleasant.</p>

                    <p>The installation of “Symphony” is planned to install by the UQ Lake in a place where
                        people have relaxing willing. And the purpose of this installation is to add some
                        music elements into a place, making people feel comfortable and enjoying the
                        environment with smooth melodies and the embrace of nature. The purpose of the
                        project is to create a collective experience and enchanting affection for the people
                        feel the pressure. Additionally, the way of engaging more people to interact with that
                        is to encourage people who don’t know each other to participate with our system
                        and evoke the passion of making new friends. The technology in this project includes
                        the pressure-sensitive sensor to detect the users’ weight and then trigger the play
                        of music. And the central computer will certify how many people interact with the
                        installation so play music with different complexity.</p>
                    <p>We are ambitious that our installation would be like by the people around the
                        campus and the visitors. We have walked through the path of the procedure of
                        collecting ideas and insights, analysing the needs from the users, videoing and
                        holding two exhibitions around the campus.</p>

                    <p>Based on the science fiction “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy” this
                        website is designed to educate the fundamental knowledge of universe and
                        space physics, targeting children aged from seven to fifteen. This design report
                        includes the background of this website and the process of design.<br> <br>
                        The target audience is children aged between 7 and 15, who have developed
                        the ability of abstract thinking and proper to learn simple physics knowledge.
                        Thus, it is suitable for them to start learning the universe and space physics.
                        The selected science fiction, published in 1979, is unlikely to be read by the
                        target audience before and the story happened in the space. Hence, this book
                        can serve not only as an enlightening of science fiction for children but also as
                        exciting teaching material for universe and space physics.

                        elements and emphasis of the visual organization have been highlighted.
                        Considering the discussion, the visual organization of this website has been
                        modified, and the wireframes have been produced (the wireframes include
                        those of the first visit page, explore page, guidebook page, search page and

                        The paper prototype test, which based on the wireframes, involved three
                        participants. After the analysis of the process and feedback, some function of
                        buttons and prompt have been modified. Besides, during the test, the tutor
                        pointed out that technically, there will not be a database to store the username
                        and password. Therefore, all the functions linked to the users' account need to
                        be redesigned.

                        The aesthetics test is conducting to determaine whether the color, font,
                        image used and button used is suitable for the content and user experience.
                        The prototype changed in this step as the feedback from participants showed
                        that the initial prototype was not suitable.<br> <br>
                        With the new prototype, the aesthetics test was reconducted and based on
                        the feedback, a hi-fi prototype was conducted. The final change isbased on
                        the feedback of hi-fi prototype.</p>

                    <p>
                        This prototype is a game of simulating the hatching and players would be hungry in the game. The
                        idea is generated by the website “Game Generator” (figure 1.1) but the animals has changed to
                        monsters and getting bored has changed to losing the physical and mental strength.

                    <p>The game mainly contains four parts, weighing, hatching, store and player status. The weighing
                        system is where players weigh the eggs and decided where to hatch the eggs. The hatching system
                        is where the players place the eggs and waiting for the monster to be born. The store is where
                        the player sells the monster and buy more eggs or foods. Player would lose physical strength
                        when hatching the eggs so they need to eat to stay alive. They can choose to eat cheap monster
                        meat to increase some physical strength but would lose mental strength. Or, they can choose to
                        eat expensive normal food to get both physical and mental strength. The game ends when either
                        the physical or the mental strength become zero.<br> <br>
                        To interact with the game, a pressure sensor decorated as a weighing scale and a physical
                        platform with controllers would be used. Players use the weighing scale to weigh the eggs and
                        the weight would display on the screen. Players can move the controller on the platform, which
                        in the game is the action of moving in the game scene or moving the little ghost assistant. The
                        platform is also the simulation of the store where users can choose to buy products.

                    <p>The prototype is a unity scene which contains the system of buying, weighing, hatching and
                        collection displaying. The buying has been simplified to spend money and gain energy. Images
                        from the Internet are used to build up the scene and some coding are used to provide the basic
                        interaction.<br> <br>
                        The prototype also linked to the physical controller by using Arduino. Two potentiometers are
                        used to move to different part of the scene and move the ghost. A photocell is used to feed the
                        players. A gravity sensor FlexiForce is used to weighing the egg. All the physical controller
                        has been put into a box which stands for the laboratory. And some text has been written on the
                        box to indicate the players.

                        The first one is buying eggs. Players are able to buy an egg from the provider and the egg is
                        randomly provided. Once they buy the egg, the egg would be placed on the shelf from top to
                        bottom.

                        egg. Players are able to control the ghost, moving it up and down. By short press the main
                        control button, the ghost would take the egg from the shelf or put it back. The egg’s position
                        is decided by the ghost position. If players long press the main control button, the ghost would
                        put the egg on the weighing scale.</p>

                        part-selecting a place to hatch. The incubator has point out which part should be putted at
                        which position. The ghost would, again, help players to put the egg at right position.</p>

                        the monster. When long press the main control button and begin to hatching, all the eggs would
                        go into the tube and players are able to begin a new round of weighing. After hatching, the
                        monster would show up at the monster box. If there are not enough eggs on the shelf, the monster
                        can still be hatched but the success possibility would be reduced. If the hatching is failed,
                        players can only get ash at the end. </p>

                        Players are expected to first put the eggs on the weighing scale and then press the button to
                        weigh the egg. After knowing the weight, they need to check which position is the best place to
                        put the egg and when the four position all have their eggs, players can begin to hatching.

                    <p>
                        The last part is the player status data. The data includes two parts, money and energy. Every
                        time players buy an egg, it would cost money, and hatching monsters can give the money back. If
                        a monster is been successfully hatched, players can get more money than the eggs cost. However,
                        there is a chance that players could not success, so that is when they can only get a little
                        money. </p>

                        The action of weighing and hatching can cost energy. When the energy become 0, the game ends.
                        But the money can be spent to buy energy. This is regarded as the simulation of selling monsters
                        and buying food.
